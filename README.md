Sensor_Fusion_Nanodegree_Projects:This repository contains projects using LiDAR, Camera, Radar and Kalman Filters for Sensor Fusion. Since each type of sensors has their inherit strengths and limitations, it is important to investigate how they can complement each other to provide the most reliable results when attempting to determine the position.
